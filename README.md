Okay PCloud, Show As Is (oPsai).
====================================================
oPsai project is a client side PCloud in Android.

This is oPsai daemon test version for armeabiv7 archi. 

The project is being built on  with Android version  ,
Kernel version   and CWR version . 

Thought it is a branch of LibVNCServer, it rarely uses the code or plugins. 

As someone (JS), "HIGHLY QUALIFIED" software developer did not have time to answer a few questions, I decided to take the problem from the scractch and update it. 

Unlike SOMEONE, shot me an email if you have a question.

Virtual Networking Protocol (VNC) and Remote FrameBuffer (RFB) are developed by RealVNC.
